🚀 ThreadWord Analyzer – A High-Performance Multithreaded File Processor

ThreadWord Analyzer is a powerful C# application that efficiently processes large text files using multithreading to enhance performance. With an intuitive GUI, users can specify the number of threads (sections) for parallel processing and analyze word occurrences within a file.

Key Features:
✅ Multithreading Technology – Splits the file into sections, each processed by a separate thread for faster results.
✅ Custom Thread Configuration – Users can define the number of threads to optimize performance.
✅ Word Occurrence Analysis – Counts occurrences of a specific word in each section.
✅ Comprehensive Word Frequency Table – Displays the count of all words in the file after processing.
✅ Search Functionality – Allows users to search for a word and view its occurrence count instantly.
✅ User-Friendly GUI – Simple and interactive interface for seamless processing.
✅ Smooth UI Experience – Uses asynchronous processing to prevent UI freezing or hanging during execution.

How It Works:
1️⃣ Load a text file into the application.
2️⃣ Choose the number of threads for processing.
3️⃣ Enter a specific word to analyze.
4️⃣ Click Start, and each thread processes its assigned section.
5️⃣ View the occurrences of the word across different sections.
6️⃣ Click Show Table to display a frequency table for all words in the file.
7️⃣ Use the search input to find the occurrence of a specific word.

Technologies Used:
🟢 C# .NET – Core programming language
⚡ Multithreading – Optimized performance using parallel processing
📊 WinForms/WPF – User-friendly graphical interface
🔄 Asynchronous UI Handling – Ensures smooth user interaction without lag
